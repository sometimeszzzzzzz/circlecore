    A suspicious hit in a replay, specifically so because it snaps away from

    Parameters
    ----------
    time: int
        The time value of the middle datapoint, in ms. 0 represents the
        beginning of the replay.
    angle: float
        The angle between the three datapoints.

        ``min(dist_a_b, dist_b_c)`` if ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are three
